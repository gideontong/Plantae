# Plantae 🌱
**Plantae** is a web application that allows you to identify and learn about almost any plant you find.

## Getting Started
Don't know how the UI will work yet, will update this section later.

## Installation
**Plantae** is seperated into the *client* and *server*. The *client* folder contains the front end code and the *server* folder contains the back end code. To run **Plantae** locally, you'll need to run both of these parts at the same time as they communicate with eachother. 

Client:
  - First, install Gatsby globally: `npm install -g gatsby`
  - Install package dependencies: `cd client && npm install`
  - Run the client: `gatsby develop`
  - Open browser to `localhost:8000`

Server:
  - Install dependencies: `cd server && pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run the server: `flask run`


## Tech
Client:
  - React
  - [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

Server:
  - Python
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

## Legal
We are not professional botanists or toxicologists. Take any information displayed in this application with a grain of salt. The authors, any contributors, and any images or infographics used are not responsible if you hurt yourself or others. **Plantae** is primarily an educational resource and not a survival guide to edible plants. Just because this application states a plant is not toxic to eat does not mean you should eat it. Stay safe and use common sense.
